A temporary folder containing all of the ground node software used for Summer 2018 (will be put into respective subfolders later). 

cc-tests performs two cross correlations at different windows (the window values were changed during testing) in order to test the synchronicity of data streams after cross correlation. cc-tests only does post-processing for a finite sampling period. 

main.sh contains the naive approach towards continuous sampling with cross correlation. main.sh calls extract.sh which continuously extracts samples (extract.sh has a dedicated core). main.sh also calls fileclean.sh which copies each file to a separate file (in which post processing will be performed). After copying the files, fileclean.sh clears all four files at the same time. main.sh then performs cross correlation twice on the copied files (just like cc-tests). Unfortunately, there was not enough data in the copied files to perform cross correlation, which perplexes me given that the cross correlation window values were within the 2 second sampling period of 2.3 MS/s.

Please note that that the copying of files does not have to be done at the same time (window sizes within two second sleep delays will have data corresponding to the same time; however, the copied files could be greater or less than each other (but not less than a two second sampling window)). Files do have to be cleared synchronously so that a timing offset is not added to a specific data stream.
