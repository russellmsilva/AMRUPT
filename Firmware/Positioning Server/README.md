Angle of arrival measurements from multiple Raspberry Pi basestations are transmitted to a central computing unit for radio tag triangulation 

The Triangulation Algorithm folder contains psuedocode that will be very similar to the triangulation algorithm used in the final design which will be used to track two dimensional positions of radio tags once accurate angle of arrivals have been achieved.
